# Learning Browserify

Need this to bring in three-js packages. Also it just seems cool.

Shout out to [Scotch](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-browserify): thanks for the excellent blog post.

Globally install browserify. Then source in your bundle after your main, and run ```browserify main.js -o bundle.js```.
